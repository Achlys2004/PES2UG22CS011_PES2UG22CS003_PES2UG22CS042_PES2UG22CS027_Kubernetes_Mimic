Running Kube-9 with Postman and Docker Integration
Here's a step-by-step guide to test your Kubernetes-like application using Postman, including the Docker integration.

Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Ensure Docker is running on your system
Make sure your database is properly configured in config.py
Install any missing dependencies:

    pip install docker flask-migrate ipaddress

Step 2: Run Your Application
First, apply migrations if you haven't already:

    in README

Start your application:

    python app.py

Step 3: Test with Postman
Collection Setup
Create a new Postman collection named "Kube-9" with these folders:


1. Test Node Operations
Create a Node
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/nodes/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:

{
  "name": "worker-1",
  "cpu_cores_avail": 4,
  "node_type": "worker"
}

Create a Master Node
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/nodes/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:

{
  "name": "master-1",
  "cpu_cores_avail": 8,
  "node_type": "master"
}

List All Nodes
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/nodes/

Check Node Health
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/nodes/health


2. Test Pod Operations (with Docker Integration)
Create a Simple Pod
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/pods/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:

{
  "name": "nginx-pod",
  "cpu_cores_req": 1,
  "containers": [
    {
      "name": "nginx",
      "image": "nginx:latest",
      "cpu_req": 0.5,
      "memory_req": 256
    }
  ]
}

Create a Pod with Volume and Config
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/pods/
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:

{
  "name": "web_app_1",
  "cpu_cores_req": 2,
  "containers": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "image": "httpd:latest",
      "cpu_req": 1.0,
      "memory_req": 512
    }
  ],
  "volumes": [
    {
      "name": "data-volume",
      "type": "emptyDir",
      "size": 1,
      "path": "/data"
    }
  ],
  "config": [
    {
      "name": "env-config",
      "type": "env",
      "key": "ENV_TYPE",
      "value": "production"
    }
  ]
}

List All Pods
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/pods/

Check Pod Health
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/pods/1/health
(Replace '1' with the actual pod ID from the list pods response)

Delete a Pod
Method: DELETE
URL: http://localhost:5000/pods/1
(Replace '1' with the actual pod ID)


3. Verify Docker Integration
After creating pods, verify Docker created the containers:

    # Check Docker containers
    docker ps

    # Check Docker networks
    docker network ls | grep pod-network

    # Check Docker volumes
    docker volume ls | grep pod

Step 4: Troubleshooting Tips
Connection Issues:
 -Ensure your firewall allows connections to port 5000
 -Try http://127.0.0.1:5000 if localhost doesn't work

Docker Issues:
 -Check Docker daemon is running: docker info
 -Verify Python has permissions to access Docker: docker ps should work from command line
Database Issues:
 -If you see the column errors about docker_container_id, run:
    flask db migrate -m "Add Docker fields"
    flask db upgrade

API Response Issues:
 -Check app logs for detailed error information
 -Verify the JSON payload matches the expected format

This should help you test your Kubernetes-like application through Postman while verifying the Docker integration works correctly.

What's Missing in Kube-9 (Simplified)
Your Kubernetes-like system is impressive, but here are the key features missing:

1. Services and Load Balancing
No way to expose pods to other pods or external users through stable IPs or DNS names

2. Deployments for Scaling
Missing the ability to run multiple replicas of pods and scale them up/down

3. Rolling Updates
No way to update applications without downtime by gradually replacing pods

4. Dashboard UI
Currently API-only with no visual interface to monitor and manage resources

5. Monitoring and Logging
Basic health checks exist, but no comprehensive metrics collection or log aggregation

6. Storage Classes
No dynamic persistent volume provisioning with different storage options

These are the most important features that would bring your simulation closer to a real Kubernetes system while still keeping the core functionality focused.
